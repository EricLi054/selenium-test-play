## Extract_Extent_Reports.bat

Use this little .bat to automagically extract and organise the Extent Reports from Download All Logs in Azure DevOps.
 
It's intended that you extract that main .zip to a folder, then run this .bat from the ```..\{ReleaseNameHere}\\AttemptX\2_Agent job\``` folder. It will create a new ExtentReports folder and extract the 3 Extent Report Archives into subfolders of that folder.
